pyinvaiders
-----------
pyinvaiders is a clone of the popular space shooter game from the 80's, it is
written in Python and utilises Pygame. All of the assets for this game were
created using GIMP, however, I do *not* claim ownership of the artwork or the
idea itself.

pyinvaiders was created with the purpose of alleviating the boredom between
my second and final year at Coventry University, along with it being a great
experience to learn about game development.
